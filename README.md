## Idea: 

The game will be simple, get to the other side. The player and some of the AI will try to get to the wall of the enemy. While the second AI will try to shoot as many as possible.

## The player 

The player will be able to cross a maze/obstacle course. When they do so, an AI will try the same. They will be shot at by our other AI. To win the game you must get to the wall. There are checkpoints scattered around the map, you are safe there. The checkpoints will be safe and will have a healing effect. 

## The AI 

### the runner
Our AI will be trained to cross the maze/obstacle course, they will try to do so while evading the bullets. When the AI is hit, it will die and get -â€¦ score. When they reach the end/ checkpoints the AI will get +1 score. The AI will try to get to the end of the maze/ obstacle course. when it does the enemy loses one of its soldiers. When all your soldiers are dead, you will lose the game. 

### the gunner
The second AI will be the gunner, it can look around the PlaySpace and must shoot the runners, if it shoots a runner, it will get a +1 score, when one of the runners gets to a checkpoint it will get a minus score. The gunner will not have unlimited bullets, it can shoot a couple of bullets at the same time.
